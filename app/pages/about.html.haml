        %article
          %h3 My name is Paul Ogden and I am a recent graduate of Portland Code School.
          %p For the past 6 months I have been learning full stack web development with a focus on Ruby on Rails.  From the beginning of my programming training I have been practicing Test Driven Development.  This has allowed me to develop an appreciation for the type of code that it helps you to write.
